# Hooks

The `hooks` directory contains custom React hooks that are used to share stateful logic between components. By extracting component logic into reusable hooks, we can avoid code duplication and make our components cleaner and more focused on their presentation.

## Custom Hooks

- **`useFadeSlideInOnFocus`:** A hook that animates a component with a fade and slide-in effect when the screen comes into focus.
- **`useScaleFadeIn`:** A hook that animates a component with a scale and fade-in effect.
- **`useChartEntranceAndPulse`:** A hook that animates a chart with an entrance and pulse effect.
